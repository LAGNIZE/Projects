	/*.split takes a string and splits it into an array based on the character(s) passed to it '' in this case.
	.map works like a for loop but takes a function as an argument. That function is applied to every member of the array.
	.join does the opposite of .split. It takes an Array and concatenates it into a string based on the character(s) passed to it.
